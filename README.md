# Call-Center-Case-Study
This project involves analyzing call center data using a Power BI dashboard. The dashboard provides insights into call handling metrics, agent performance, and customer satisfaction.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Effective call center management requires understanding various metrics related to call handling and agent performance. This includes tracking call volumes, resolution rates, agent efficiency, and customer satisfaction. The goal of this project is to address the following problems:
1. How many calls are handled by the call center, and what proportion are answered and resolved?
2. What is the performance of individual agents in terms of calls answered, call speed and issue resolution?
3. How does overall customer satisfaction correlate with call center metrics?
4. What are the common issues faced and the distribution of calls by topic?


APPROACH:
To address these problems, the following approach was used:
1. Data Collection: Collected comprehensive data on call center operations, including total calls, answered calls, issue resolutions, agent performance, and customer satisfaction.
2. Data Cleaning: Processed and cleaned the data to ensure accuracy, handling any missing or inconsistent values.
3. Dashboard Creation: Developed a Power BI dashboard with the following features:

Total Calls: Displayed the total number of calls received by the call center.
Answered Calls: Visualized the number of calls that were answered.
Issue Resolved: Showed the count of calls where issues were resolved.
Total Agents: Listed the total number of agents working at the call center.
Average Calls Answered: Analyzed the average number of calls answered per agent.
Average Call Speed: Displayed the average time taken to answer calls.
Most Issues Resolved by Agent: Identified which agent resolved the most issues.
Most Calls Missed by Agent: Showed which agent missed the most calls.
Top-Rated Agent: Highlighted the agent with the highest customer satisfaction ratings.
Count of Calls by Per Agent: Visualized the number of calls handled by each agent.
Overall Customer Satisfaction Rate: Displayed the overall satisfaction rate of customers.
Count of Calls by Topic: Analyzed the number of calls categorized by different topics.
Call Distribution: Visualized the distribution of calls across various metrics.
Analysis and Insights: Conducted analysis based on the dashboard visualizations to derive insights into call center performance, agent effectiveness, and areas for improvement.

Conclusion
The Call Center Data Analysis Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of call center operations, highlighting key metrics such as call volumes, agent performance, and customer satisfaction. By visualizing these metrics, the dashboard helps in identifying high-performing agents, understanding call handling efficiency, and improving overall customer service. This analysis is valuable for optimizing call center operations and enhancing the customer experience.
